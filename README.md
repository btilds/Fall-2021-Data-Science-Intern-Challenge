# Fall 2021 Data Science Intern Challenge

Question 1 is attached as a Python Jupyter notebook. It runs assuming you have the Google Sheets data table downloaded as a CSV file in the same directory as the notebook.

Question 2 is answered in the word document with the challenge instructions, as specified in the challenge instructions and in the Python Jupyter notebook for question 2.
